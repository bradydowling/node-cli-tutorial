summary: Now lets drop some comments into our code so we can orient ourselves with each step we take and we know where to add certain bits of code. Because this is a CLI, we'll be prompting the user over and over for information until they choose to exit. This is a good fit for a while loop in which we can specify which selection the user made.

⇥
  // Welcome user↓⇥
  // Get initial data

  // Initialize prompt variables

  // Loop through CLI selections
  while(!exit) {
    // Handle selection
    // Get next selection
  }
