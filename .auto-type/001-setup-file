file: index.js
summary: First we're going to setup our file. We'll import `enquirer` since we're definitely going to be using that later on and then we'll setup a main function where we can run eventually some async code and the rest of our CLI.

import enquirer from 'enquirer';

const runCli = async () => {
  console.log("Thanks for consuming sports headlines responsibly!");
  console.log("Thanks for using the ESPN cli!");
  return;
}

runCli();
